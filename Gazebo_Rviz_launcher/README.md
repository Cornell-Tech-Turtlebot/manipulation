# Launch Basic Gazebo + Rviz Environment

### This folder is for prototyping of simple scripts that automatically launch the Gazebo and Rviz environments using bash scripts. The purpose of these bash scripts is to enhance the guidance in the Simulation Section of the existing [ROS Open Manipulator Tutorial](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/overview).  


## How to use the scripts

To run, launch a terminal and execute 'bash om.sh'.
<br>
'om' is short for open manipulator.

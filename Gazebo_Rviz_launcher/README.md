# Launch Basic Gazebo + Rviz Environment

## This branch is for prototyping of simple scripts that automatically launch the Gazebo and Rviz environments using bash scripts.

## The purpose of this branch is to enhance the guidance in the Simulation Section of the existing [ROS Open Manipulator Tutorial](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/overview).
